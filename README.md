# VERA - Verifiable Evidence-grounded Reasoning Architecture

A categorical verification system that transcends traditional RAG by making verification a first-class citizen through natural transformations.

## Status

**Phase**: Planning Complete - Awaiting Human Gate Approval

See [`specs/HUMAN-GATE-REVIEW.md`](specs/HUMAN-GATE-REVIEW.md) for the complete review package.

## Core Concept

VERA treats verification as a **natural transformation (eta)** insertable at any point in the pipeline:

```
Pipeline[A,B] --eta--> Pipeline[A, Verified[B]]
```

This is fundamentally different from RAG which generates first, verifies later (or not at all).

| [`specs/MVP-SPEC.md`](specs/MVP-SPEC.md) | MVP specification |
| [`specs/PRODUCTION-SPEC.md`](specs/PRODUCTION-SPEC.md) | Production specification |
| [`specs/BUILD-PLAN.md`](specs/BUILD-PLAN.md) | Implementation roadmap |

## Constitution (9 Immutable Articles)

1. **Verification as First-Class** - Every claim must be verifiable
2. **Composition Over Configuration** - Behavior from composition, not config
3. **Provider Agnosticism** - No LLM logic in business logic
4. **Human Ownership** - Any file understood in <10 min
5. **Type Safety** - Invalid states unrepresentable
6. **Categorical Correctness** - Laws verified through tests
7. **No Mocks in MVP** - Real capability demonstration
8. **Graceful Degradation** - Explicit failure handling
9. **Observable by Default** - Traces, logs, metrics

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go with generics
- **FP Library**: IBM fp-go (Result[T], Either, Option)
- **CLI**: Cobra
- **LLM**: Anthropic SDK (MVP), multi-provider (Production)
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry
